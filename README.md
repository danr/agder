# Agders Projekt

An online judge for Agda problems. The name means "Project Agder" in Swedish,
and is derived from the popular page "Project Euler".

This page is hosted sporadically at http://213.112.79.212/, but I am looking
for a better place to host it. Offers are more than welcome to
danr@student.chalmers.se.

Pull requests with new problems or features are most appreciated!
